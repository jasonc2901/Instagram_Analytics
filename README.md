# Instagram Analytics App

A Full Stack Instagram Analytics App built with Flutter and a Python Rest API backend.

## Background

This project is my second attempt of building a full stack application. I designed and built a Python Rest API from scratch using Flask and implemented a smart Instagram data retrieval method using the Instaloader third party module, I opted for a third party resource as the Instagram Official API does not have the features I needed.

I then built out the frontend Application using the Flutter/Dart programming language and connected it to the rest api using the BLoC pattern method.
